LSE_DA201_Assignment

file name: metadata_nhs.txt – metadata of the three CSV files combined
                              The three CSV files are: actual_duration.csv,
                                                       appointments_regioal.csv, 
                                                       national_categories.csv. 


Data quality:
Data is collected from GP systems that are designed to be flexible and for practices 
to use in everyday work and not for the purpose of data analysis. There are no national 
standards for data entry about activity, and there is widespread variation in approach 
to appointment management between practices. This means that there are variations in 
data quality between practices.

**************************************************************************************

NOTE:
The metadata is based on the original data set. For this assignment, the data set 
(CSV files) were cleaned for you. For example, unnecessary columns were dropped to 
decrease file size. 

***************************************************************************************

KEY INFORMATION:
The raw data uses the term count to calculate, for example, the number of appointments.
The word count refers to the number of values meeting a certain condition, while the 
word sum indicates the total of a number of values. For example, if we have five cells 
with different values (e.g. 20, 10, 5, 50, 25), the count of the cells will be five, 
while the sum of the values will be 100.

***************************************************************************************

General information regarding data sets:

1) Sub-ICB location level:

1a) Daily counts, at Sub-ICB Location level:
The CSV files include data for each calendar month during the 30-month reporting period. 
The data is aggregated to daily counts, including breakdowns for Appointment Status, 
Healthcare Professional, Mode of Appointment, and Time between Booking and Appointment. 
The data is aggregated to Sub-ICB Location level, with NHS Geographies included. 
There is also a coverage file included, providing the number of practices or patients
included in the publication and the total number for the Sub-ICB Location for each
month in the reporting period. These files can be used to look at appointments across 
all regions for a particular day, week or month. For example, you can look at the daily
count of telephone appointments with an appointment status of Attended by NHS
commissioning region.

1b) Regional counts, at Sub-ICB Location level:
The CSV files include data for each ICB for the 30-month reporting period. The data 
is aggregated to monthly counts, including breakdowns for Appointment Status, 
Healthcare Professional, Mode of Appointment, and Time between Booking and Appointment. 
The data is aggregated to Sub-ICB Location level, with NHS Geographies up to NHS 
Commissioning Region included. These files can be used to look at appointments data 
for a particular geography during the full reporting period. For example, you can 
look at the monthly time series count of face-to-face appointments by Sub-ICB Location 
for a chosen ICB.

1c) Fields included:
sub_icb_location_code
sub_icb_location_name
sub_icb_location_ons_code
icb_ons_code
region_ons_code
appointment_month
time_between_book_and_appointment
count_of_appointments
hcp_type
appointment_mode
appointment_status


2) Appointment status (appointment_status):
The appointment status shows whether the appointment is available, booked, has been 
attended by the patient (or not), or has been cancelled. This status changes over 
time, for example when a patient makes a booking, the appointment status changes 
from ‘Available’ to ‘Booked’. This release reports the final status of each 
appointment. 

In most cases, at the time of the appointment a ‘Booked’ status will be changed to 
either ‘Attended’ or ‘DNA’ (Did Not Attend). In some cases (3%–6% of monthly appointments), 
the final status of an appointment remains as ‘Booked’. It is not known from the data 
whether or not these appointments actually attended. For this reason, the status of these 
appointments is reported as 'Unknown'.

Due to an issue with the data collection, DNA appointments were not captured correctly 
after June 2018 and are under-reported until and including November 2018 for all 
practices using the TPP SystmOne system.


3) Appointment mode (appointment_mode)
The mode of the appointment shows the setting of the consultation. For example, face to face, 
telephone, or home visits. This is set locally by the practices so it may not represent the actual 
care setting of the appointment. For example, some video conference appointments may be logged 
by the practice as face to face.

Most face to face time is booked as individual appointment time, typically with one patient 
attending each time slot. By contrast, many telephone triage and home visits appear as one 
long blocked period and are not booked (e.g. traige and home visits) to individual patients.

Some home visits and telephone triage sessions are booked in to early-morning sessions 
(6 am to 6:20 am) for each GP as untimed appointments, but the consultations happen in the 
afternoon. They are booked in to early-morning sessions so that they appear on the top of the 
appointment book screen for each GP. At some practices, home visits are logged at reception 
and not in the practice system.

Unless home visits and telephone triage are logged as individual appointments and booked to 
a patient, they will not appear in this publication. Appointments marked as online, video or 
video conference are shown as 'Online / Video'. This may or may not include a video element. 
Non-video based online consultations such as live chat or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) 
and video-based appointments are all included in this category.

Practices using the Cegedim GP system are unable to supply appointment mode data. Consequently, 
the proportion of appointments with an 'Unknown' appointment mode is higher in releases from 
July 2019 onwards when Cegedim practices were included in the publication.


4) Actual duration (actual_duration)
Actual duration data was first included in the April 2022 release with data from 
December 2021. Actual duration is the length in minutes of the consultation that
took place.

This field is recorded differently depending on the practice’s system supplier. 
For example, EMIS records the actual duration as the time between the patient being 
called into their appointment and the time the clinician records that the consultation 
is complete. TPP can record the start time as either when the consultation is started, 
when a clinician calls for a patient, or when the appointment status is changed to 
‘in progress’. The end time is recorded as when the appointment is marked as finished 
with the actual duration being the difference between these two times. This leads to 
variations in data quality that NHS Digital is continuing to work with system suppliers 
to address.

Any appointments with a null duration or a duration of less than one minute or greater 
than 60 minutes have been grouped into an ‘Unknown / Data Quality Issue’ category within 
this publication.


5) Context type (context_type)
The National Categories are subdivided into three ‘Context Types’. The context describes 
whether an appointment is an encounter relating to direct patient care, or an activity 
undertaken as part of patient care where the patient is not involved. Where category data 
is not received, an appointment is assigned to an ‘Unmapped’ context type.

Context Type – Description
Care Related Encounter – Categories within this context type involve the patient and can 
                         be any modality, e.g. face-to-face appointments, telephone 
                         consultations, video and online consultations, home visits etc.
Inconsistent Mapping – Appointment types that have been mapped but not to a Care Related 
                       Encounter are classed as Inconsistent Mapping. Appointments under 
                       this context type conflict with the description of an appointment. Work 
                       is ongoing to improve the consistency of mapping.
Unmapped – No record of a category against an appointment slot type. This could be due to 
           an error receiving the data, or an appointment type has not been mapped.


6) National categories (national_category)
Within each context type, there is an option for practices to choose a ‘Does Not Fit’ category. 
This is used only when a practice is unable to place an appointment type within one of the 
predefined categories. These appointments are assigned to the ‘Inconsistent Mapping’ context 
type with further analysis planned to establish whether new categories in future releases are 
needed, or additional assistance and guidance is required for mapping.

Context Type – National Category
Care Related Encounter – General Consultation Acute
                       – General Consultation Routine
                       – Planned Clinics
                       – Planned Clinical Procedure
                       – Unplanned Clinical Activity
                       – Walk-in, Clinical Triage, Home Visit, 	Care Home Visit
                       – Group Consultation and Group Education
                       – Structured Medication Review
                       – Patient contact during Care Home Round
                       – Care Home Needs Assessment & Personalised Care and Support Planning
                       – Social Prescribing Service
                       – Service provided by organisation external to the practice
                       – Non-contractual chargeable work
Inconsistent Mapping – Care Related Encounter but does not fit into any other category
                     – Appointment types not mapped to a Care Related Encounter


7) Service setting (service_setting)
The service setting describes the provision of care in which the appointment was delivered. 
There are four service settings. Where category data is not received, an appointment is 
assigned to an ‘Unmapped’ setting.

Service Setting – Description
General Practice – Appointments delivered by practice staff activity under the GMS/PMS/APMS 
                   contract.
Primary Care Network – Appointments delivered by staff employed or engaged under the Additional
                       Roles Reimbursement Scheme (ARRS). Appointments delivered in fulfilment 
                       of the service requirements of the Network Contract Directed Enhanced 
                       Service (DES) – e.g. Structured Medication Reviews, weekly care home 
                       rounds – with the exception of Extended Access services, for which the 
                       Extended Access Provision service setting should be used.
Extended Access Provision – Appointments commissioned as part of extended access contractual 
                            arrangements.
Other – Appointments delivered in the practice by another provider.
Unmapped – No recorded category against an appointment slot type. This could be due to an error
           receiving the data, or an appointment type has not been mapped.


8) Time from booking to appointment (time_between_book_and_appointment)
Time elapsed from when the booking was made to when the appointment happened is presented in 
this release. There are several factors that drive this variable, including:
* appointment availability at the practice
* patient availability
* urgency of the appointment
* GP advice
* regular/repeat appointments that may be booked in advance


9) Healthcare professional type (hcp_type)
Healthcare professional type (HCP type) was incorrectly extracted for some practices from 
October 2017 onwards. This has led to potential incorrect reporting of some HCP Types, 
including nurses. The only HCP type currently collected with high enough consistency for 
publication is GP. Therefore, all other HCP types are reported as 'Other Practice Staff' 
throughout this release.

Blank or missing HCP types are due to the use of generic lists for GPs (for example visits and 
prescription requests) or staff not set up correctly on the system (for example medical 
students and team leaders).

Where HCP type is included, it has been grouped in the following way.
The occupations grouped as HCP type 'GP' are:
* GP registrar
* Locum GP
* Principal GP

The occupations grouped as HCP type 'Other Practice Staff' are:
* Acupuncturist
* Chiropodist
* Community Psychiatric Nurse
* Counsellor
* Dispenser
* District Nurse
* Health Visitor
* Interpreter/Link Worker
* Osteopath
* Other Practice Staff
* Physiotherapist
* Practice Nurse

If HCP type is recorded as NULL/Missing Data, it will be classified as Unknown. It is possible 
that a small proportion of GP appointments are classified within Other Practice Staff due to 
incorrect mappings with data suppliers, for example, Trainee GP or GP Partner. For information 
on how this differs from SDS Role Group go to the SDS Role Group section.


10) Date of appointment (appointment_date)
The date the appointment was made for by the patient.


11) Month of appointment (appointment_month)
The month in which the appointment is.


12) Number of appointments (Ccount_of_appointments)
Estimated number of total appointments
Not all practices in England are included in this release (see Data Quality: Practice Coverage)
meaning the total number of appointments is not known. An estimate of the total number of 
appointments in England has been provided. The estimate is calculated by taking the number of 
registered patients from missing practices and doing a simple calculation based on the number 
of appointments per registered patient from the practices included in the data collection.

An example of this calculation for November 2019 is shown below:
Open, active practices in England – 6,837
Number of practices included in the data collection – 6,538
Percentage of practices included in the data collection – 95.6%
Registered patients at open, active practices – 60,198,781
Registered patients at practices included in the data collection – 58,042,831
Percentage of patients included in the data collection – 96.4%
Total number of appointments – 26,448,308
Calculation = total number of 
appointments divided by 
percentage of patients included
in the data collection          – 26,448,308 / 0.964
Calculation result – 27,430,707.18
Estimated England total count of appointments - 27,430,000

This estimate does not include all GP activity or provide information about demand or capacity 
of appointments in general practice.
